# Motivation

## Meet Alice

- Alice is a *computational biologist*
- Her new work involves solving a non-smooth optimization problem.

- She has no expericence with this.
- She wants to find the best algorithm for her specific problem and a software library she can use.
- She does not really know how to get an overview of what her options are.
- A google scholar search is daunting.
- Luckily, she has a colleague, who has had a similar problem before, she can ask for advice.

## Meet Bob

- Bob is an expert in model reduction.
- He wants to follow current research in his field and compare his algorithms to the state of the art of competing methods.

- He's clearly too busy to follow [math.NA](https://arxiv.org/list/math.NA/recent), and not everything is there.
- There is no useable AMS classification. Keywords? But which?
- Luckily, he can follow all relevant researchers on ResearchGate and meet them at conferences.
- Implementing a competitor's method and comparing it to his own is too much work, so he does not do it.

## The underlying problems

No way to directly search/get suggestions for:

- journal articles discussing a specific algorithm
- (benchmark) experiments comparing algorithms for a specific problem
- implementing software
- algorithms that solve a certain mathematical problem
- algorithms similar to a given algorithm

----

## Our goal

Build and maintain a knowledge graph of numerical algorithms
    which interlinks those algorithms with the addressed mathematical problems and associated research
    data such as journal papers, benchmarks or implementing software packages.
